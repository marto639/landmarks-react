            Images may be two or three-dimensional, such as a photograph or screen
            display, or three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram. They may be
            captured by optical devices - such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes,
            microscopes, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human eye or
            water. The word 'image' is also used in the broader sense of any
            two-dimensional figure such as a map, a graph, a pie chart, a painting or a
            banner. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by
            drawing, the art of painting, carving, rendered automatically by printing or
            computer graphics technology, or developed by a combination of methods,
            especially in a pseudo-photograph. A volatile image is one that exists only
            for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror,
            a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode ray tube.
            A fixed image, also called a hard copy, is one that has been recorded on a
            material object, such as paper or textile by photography or any other digital
            process. A mental image exists in an individual's mind, as something one
            remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an
            abstract concept, such as a graph, function, or imaginary entity. For example,
            Sigmund Freud claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs.
